### Hi there!
Welcome to the website of **Diaz Tang**.

I am currently a freelance who is exploring different interests and getting to try different things. I am also an Game Master of Panda MineCraft Server. Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au).

I was born in Shanghai on September 11th, 2002. My zodiac sign is **Virgo** and my MBTI is **INTJ** (only 2.1% worldwide, one of the rarest). Since this personality, I tend to be more rational and can often solve problems dialectically.

**Main interests include:**<br>
- **🎮 Game:** Switch / Playstation 5 / PC.<br>
- **⛺️ Travel:** Self-driving tour / Japan (Tokyo/Osaka)<br>
- **🌍 Do Projects:** Portfolio on Social Phenomena / Server Development (MineCraft)<br>

Right now, I just want to relax myself and challenge myself. If you are interested, please fell free to contact me via [Email](mailto:diaztang@mcfans.cn) or [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg)!
